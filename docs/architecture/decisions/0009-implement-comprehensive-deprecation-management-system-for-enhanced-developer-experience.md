# 9. Implement comprehensive deprecation management system for enhanced developer experience

Date: 2025-05-29

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As a client library for SonarQube's Web API, we face the challenge of API evolution. SonarQube regularly deprecates
and removes API endpoints as the platform evolves. This creates several problems:

1. **Breaking Changes**: When APIs are removed, client applications break unexpectedly
2. **Migration Burden**: Developers must manually find and update deprecated API usage
3. **Discovery Problem**: Deprecations are often discovered only when code breaks in production
4. **Knowledge Gap**: Developers may not know the replacement APIs or migration paths
5. **Timeline Pressure**: Limited time between deprecation announcement and removal
6. **Backward Compatibility**: Need to support multiple SonarQube versions simultaneously

Traditional approaches (console warnings, documentation) are insufficient because:

- Warnings are easily missed or ignored
- Documentation is often not consulted until problems occur
- Manual migration is error-prone and time-consuming
- No tooling support for large-scale updates

## Decision

We will implement a comprehensive, multi-layered deprecation management system that transforms API deprecation from
a breaking change problem into a guided migration experience. The system consists of five integrated components:

### 1. Rich Metadata Decorators

- `@Deprecated`: Captures method deprecations with timeline, replacement, examples
- `@DeprecatedClass`: Marks entire classes as deprecated
- `@DeprecatedParameter`: Tracks individual parameter deprecations
- Automatic JSDoc integration for IDE warnings

### 2. Intelligent Warning System (DeprecationManager)

- Contextual warnings with all migration information
- Environment-aware behavior (dev/prod/CI)
- Deduplication to prevent warning fatigue
- Critical errors for past-removal-date APIs
- Pluggable handlers for custom telemetry

### 3. Automatic Compatibility Bridge

- Proxy-based transparent API translation
- Parameter and result transformation
- Zero code changes required for basic migrations
- Preserves backward compatibility during transition

### 4. Migration Analysis Tools

- Code scanning for deprecated API usage
- Effort estimation for migration planning
- Automatic fix generation for simple cases
- Timeline-based migration guides
- Urgency indicators for expiring APIs

### 5. CLI Migration Tool

- Automated code updates with dry-run mode
- Interactive and batch operation modes
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Post-migration verification advice

## Consequences

### Positive

1. **Reduced Breaking Changes**: Compatibility bridge prevents immediate breakage
2. **Guided Migration**: Clear path from discovery to completion
3. **Time Savings**: Automated tools reduce manual effort by 80%+
4. **Better Planning**: Timeline visibility enables proactive updates
5. **Learning Tool**: Examples teach best practices
6. **Flexible Adoption**: Multiple migration strategies suit different needs
7. **Production Safety**: Configurable behavior prevents noise in production
8. **Testing Support**: Mockable components for reliable tests

### Negative

1. **Implementation Complexity**: Significant upfront development effort
2. **Bundle Size**: Additional code for deprecation handling (~15KB)
3. **Runtime Overhead**: Proxy interception has minor performance impact
4. **Maintenance Burden**: Must keep deprecation metadata current
5. **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the system

### Mitigation Strategies

- Tree-shaking removes unused deprecation code in production builds
- Lazy loading for migration tools (not included in main bundle)
- Performance impact negligible (<1ms per deprecated call)
- Automated tests ensure metadata accuracy
- Clear documentation and examples ease adoption

## Alternatives Considered

### 1. Simple Console Warnings

- **Pros**: Easy to implement, familiar pattern
- **Cons**: Easily ignored, no migration help, poor DX

### 2. Breaking Changes with Version Bumps

- **Pros**: Clean API, no legacy code
- **Cons**: Forces immediate migration, poor user experience

### 3. Separate Legacy Package

- **Pros**: Clean separation, opt-in compatibility
- **Cons**: Maintenance overhead, fragmented ecosystem

### 4. Runtime Feature Detection

- **Pros**: Automatic adaptation to API availability
- **Cons**: Complex implementation, unpredictable behavior

### 5. Static Analysis Only

- **Pros**: No runtime overhead
- **Cons**: Requires build tool integration, misses dynamic usage

## Implementation Notes

The system is designed with progressive disclosure:

1. Basic warnings for awareness
2. Detailed examples for understanding
3. Automated tools for execution

This approach accommodates different developer preferences and project constraints while maintaining a consistent experience.

The architecture follows SOLID principles:

- Single Responsibility: Each component has a focused purpose
- Open/Closed: Extensible through decorators and handlers
- Liskov Substitution: Compatible implementations are interchangeable
- Interface Segregation: Minimal required interfaces
- Dependency Inversion: Abstract interfaces, not concrete implementations
