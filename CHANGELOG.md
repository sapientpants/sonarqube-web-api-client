## 0.11.3

### Patch Changes

- [#129](https://github.com/sapientpants/sonarqube-web-api-client/pull/129) [`c50d226`](https://github.com/sapientpants/sonarqube-web-api-client/commit/c50d2266e1c9b13e65d85e2f27fe57f679df21bb) - Improve code quality by fixing 172 SonarQube issues

  Fixed all SonarQube code quality issues including:
  - Replaced `.forEach()` with `for...of` loops for better performance
  - Modernized to use `Number.parseInt` and `Number.isNaN`
  - Improved promise handling patterns (replaced `Promise.resolve()`/`Promise.reject()` with direct returns/throws)
  - Updated to `String.fromCodePoint` for Unicode safety
  - Added type annotations for better type safety

  All changes maintain existing behavior while improving code quality, performance, and maintainability.

## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- [#125](https://github.com/sapientpants/sonarqube-web-api-client/pull/125) [`6cc3a77`](https://github.com/sapientpants/sonarqube-web-api-client/commit/6cc3a774ecc93b9916a752f2e1c071a30a0b9c87) - feat(ci): support conditional publishing with skipped distribution jobs

  Enhanced the release workflow to allow GitHub releases to proceed successfully
  when Docker or npm publishing jobs are conditionally skipped, rather than
  blocking the entire release pipeline.

  Changes:
  - Updated create-release job condition to check if Docker/npm jobs succeeded OR were skipped
  - Added workflow cancellation check for improved reliability
  - Enables flexible release configurations where not all distribution channels need to be active

  This allows releases to complete successfully even when optional publishing
  steps (Docker to Docker Hub, npm to registry) are disabled via configuration
  or missing credentials, while still creating the GitHub release with artifacts.
