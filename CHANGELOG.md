### Patch Changes

- [#134](https://github.com/sapientpants/sonarqube-web-api-client/pull/134) [`768e527`](https://github.com/sapientpants/sonarqube-web-api-client/commit/768e527441051955d0ddb793cf45303fc944ecdf) - Migrate to ES2022 and Node16 module resolution

  Updated TypeScript configuration to use ES2022 target and Node16 module resolution for better ESM support and modern JavaScript features:

  **Configuration Changes:**
  - Updated `target` from ES2021 to ES2022
  - Updated `module` to Node16 for proper ESM support
  - Updated `lib` to ES2022 for modern JavaScript APIs
  - Updated `moduleResolution` to Node16

  **Code Changes:**
  - Added explicit `.js` extensions to all relative imports (312 files) as required by Node16 module resolution
  - Updated directory imports to use `/index.js` explicitly
  - Refactored `NetworkError` to use native `Error.cause` mechanism from ES2022
  - Updated test configuration to use CommonJS for backward compatibility

  **Benefits:**
  - Better ESM/CommonJS interoperability
  - Access to modern JavaScript features (e.g., native Error.cause)
  - Improved module resolution semantics
  - More explicit import paths following Node.js ESM standards

  All changes are internal build and type improvements. The public API remains unchanged with 100% backward compatibility.

### Patch Changes

- [#133](https://github.com/sapientpants/sonarqube-web-api-client/pull/133) [`8ccc961`](https://github.com/sapientpants/sonarqube-web-api-client/commit/8ccc96160f6c1520eeb43a6a1cd9c0e3ab0174de) - Fix final SonarQube code quality issues

  Fixed 21 remaining SonarQube code quality issues to achieve zero technical debt:

  **S7735 (Negated Conditions) - 2 issues:**

    - `MigrationAssistant.generateMigrationGuide()` (complexity 28 → <15)
    - `validateFixApplication()` (complexity 26 → <15)
    - `generateChangePreview()` (complexity 31 → <15)
    - `analyzeSuggestionPatterns()` (complexity 39 → <15)

## 0.11.2

### Patch Changes

- [#125](https://github.com/sapientpants/sonarqube-web-api-client/pull/125) [`6cc3a77`](https://github.com/sapientpants/sonarqube-web-api-client/commit/6cc3a774ecc93b9916a752f2e1c071a30a0b9c87) - feat(ci): support conditional publishing with skipped distribution jobs

  Enhanced the release workflow to allow GitHub releases to proceed successfully
  when Docker or npm publishing jobs are conditionally skipped, rather than
  blocking the entire release pipeline.

  Changes:
  - Updated create-release job condition to check if Docker/npm jobs succeeded OR were skipped
  - Added workflow cancellation check for improved reliability
  - Enables flexible release configurations where not all distribution channels need to be active

  This allows releases to complete successfully even when optional publishing
  steps (Docker to Docker Hub, npm to registry) are disabled via configuration
  or missing credentials, while still creating the GitHub release with artifacts.
