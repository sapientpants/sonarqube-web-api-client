Comprehensive code quality improvements and refactoring

Fixed 111 SonarQube code quality issues across the codebase:

**Performance Optimizations:**

- Replaced `.forEach()` with `for...of` loops for better performance (~40 instances)
- Replaced array push loops with `.flatMap()` for cleaner code
- Removed unnecessary decimal notation (1.0 → 1, 0.0 → 0)

**Modernization:**

- Updated Node.js imports to use `node:` prefix (`fs` → `node:fs`, `path` → `node:path`)
- Replaced `isNaN()` with `Number.isNaN()` for type-safe NaN checking
- Replaced `String#replace()` with `String#replaceAll()` for clarity
- Upgraded TypeScript target and lib from ES2020 to ES2021

**Code Complexity Reduction:**

- Fixed 4 CRITICAL cognitive complexity issues in:
  - `MigrationAssistant.generateMigrationGuide()` (complexity 28 → <15)
  - `validateFixApplication()` (complexity 26 → <15)
  - `generateChangePreview()` (complexity 31 → <15)
  - `analyzeSuggestionPatterns()` (complexity 39 → <15)
- Extracted 32 focused helper methods following Single Responsibility Principle
- Improved code organization with early returns and guard clauses

All changes maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing APIs. All 1859 tests passing.
